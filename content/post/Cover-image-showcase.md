This past summer of 2019 I travelled to Spain for three weeks where we visited Madrid, Toledo, Granada, Valencia, and Peniscola. This post will document photos and some of the history learned on the trip. This first destination on our trip was Madrid. Madrid is the captial of Spain with almost 3.2 million people.
