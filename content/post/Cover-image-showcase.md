Summer 2019 Study Abroad Trip

<!--more-->
This past summer of 2019 I travelled to Spain for three weeks where we visited Madrid, Toledo, Granada, Valencia, and Peniscola. This post will document photos and some of the history learned on the trip. This first destination on our trip was Madrid. Madrid is the capital of Spain with almost 3.2 million people. While in Spain we first visited Palacio Real as shown below.

Our next stop was Toledo which is about an hour south of Madrid. The cover image of this post was the first place we stopped in Toledo. The view was amazing. The whole city of Toledo has been named a World Heritage Site because of its beuty and all this history that is there. Its significance in history is most recognized during the Spanish Golden Age which started around 1492. In this Golden Age Moors, Jews, and Christians were able to live together in peace. While in Toledo we visited the Synagogue of Santa Maria la Blanca shown below. It was completed in 1180 making it one of the oldest synagogues in Europe. Our tour guide explained that the pillars inside were made with 8 sides which signified eternal life and the Golden Age.

After visiting Toledo we traveled to the east coast city of Valencia where we would stay for the rest of the trip. We lived with actual locals there for two weeks. Valencia is known for its City of Arts and Sciences shown below. Valencia also has many beautiful beaches and a walking park that stretches for miles.

Below is an image of the walking park in Valencia. This used to be a water reserve canal many years ago but was converted into a park to promote physical activity and conservation of energy. Valencia has been experiencing droughts for many years and is feeling the affects of climate change already. Because of this they are very energy conscious. They do not waste any water and always turn lights off when leaving a room. The park includes many outside workout machines, several soccer fields and basketball courts.

On the weekend we took another trip to Granada which is home to the Alhambra. Granada is known for its medieval architecture such as the Alhambra, a hilltop fortress complex (shown below). Granada is also the city where the Reconquista concluded when Emir Muhammad XII surrended control of the Emirate of Granada to Fredinand and Queen Isabella (The Catholic Monarchs). This is also the burial place of The Catholic Monarchs.

Below is image of Alhambra inside the fortress. The Alhambra is almost a mile long and about 700 feet in width. It was built on a rocky hill with a deep ravine at the base of the plateau for added protection. The complex is divided into three different sections: Mexuar, Serallo, and the Harem.

The Mexuar was a place where business and other administrative functions were preformed shown below.

The Serallo is a much more finished part of the complex that includes the Court of the Myrtles with a reflective pool at the center.

The Serallo also includes the Ambassadors Hall, the largest hall in the Alhambra. It is also the hall where Christopher Columbus recieved his endorsements from the Catholic Monarchs to discover the "New World".

The Harem includes the Hall of the Abencerrages and the Hall of the Two Sisters with incredible honeycombed ceilings.

During the trip we also decided to take a day trip to the city of Peniscola. It was a two hour train ride south down the coast. Its known for its 13-century Peniscola castle shown below. The TV show Game of Thrones was also filmed here at the castle.

My time in Spain was very eye opening. For the most part everything you can find here in the US you can find there. What really makes it special are the subtle cultural differences and the amazing architecture. Spaniards live a much more relaxed life style. In Spain they also use meals as a social gathering where meals can take two to three hours. They also eat dinner much later at night around 8 pm usually. I also noticed that their cities are much more friendly to public transportation. This may be because they make an effort to conserve energy. Overall I had a great time learning about Spain and made a lot of great friends during the trip.
